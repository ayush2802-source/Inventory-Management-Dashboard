# Inventory Management Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to optimize inventory management through data-driven insights and automated reporting. This project focuses on enhancing stock visibility, enabling timely replenishment, and significantly reducing manual efforts for inventory planners.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This dashboard provides a robust solution for tracking over 300 SKUs by implementing an ABC-XYZ classification system, offering granular visibility into stock levels across various demand and value segments. It integrates critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to present a clear, real-time picture of inventory health and performance.

The primary goal was to transform raw inventory data into actionable insights, facilitating proactive decision-making and improving operational efficiency.
